Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer repository! This project is a tool for visualizing different pathfinding algorithms, such as A*, and Breadth-First Search. 

To get started with the Pathfinding Visualizer, clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Once the page is loaded, you will see a grid with some pre-defined walls.

Once your grid is set up, you can press the "Visualize" button to watch the algorithm in action. The visualization will show the path that the algorithm (A* for now) takes as it traverses through the grid and searches for the shortest path.


Built With React.Js

If you're interested in contributing to this project, please reach out to the owner of this repo, or open a pull request with your proposed changes.

Upcoming features

=> Selecting your own start and end point.
=> Setting up your own walls.
=> A dropdown menu for selecting different algorithms.
....and much more

Acknowledgments

Inspiration for this project came from my curiosity to understand the inner workings of pathfinding algorithms and how they navigate through a grid.

Thanks for checking out the Pathfinding Visualizer! We hope you find it useful and enjoy using it.
